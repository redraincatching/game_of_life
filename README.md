conway's game of life

a turing machine made from a grid of squares, whose "lives" pass in ticks, and are determined by a set of rules:

1) live squares with 2 or 3 living neighbours stay alive
2) live squares with any other number die
3) dead cells with exactly 3 living neighbours return to life

the board should theoretically be infinite, but, well, yeah.
so technically it's a linear bounded automaton? maybe? who knows
